            Hello, I'm Guillermo Kramsky, and I'm genuinely passionate about coding. The blend of creativity, logic, and the power to create truly fascinates me. I consider myself a person who finds joy in discipline and consistency.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p className="hero--section-description">
            Beyond coding, I maintain a healthy balance in life with a dedicated fitness routine at the gym â€“ a principal and recurring hobby. I also relish my free time, whether it's socializing with friends, taking walks in the park, exploring new destinations through travel, or simply embracing the opportunities that this limited journey called life offers.
